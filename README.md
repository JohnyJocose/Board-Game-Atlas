Board Game Connect - Senior Year Creative Project

Welcome to the repository for 'Board Game Connect,' my senior year creative project! This project was born out of my passion for board games and mobile app development. 'Board Game Connect' aimed to provide a platform for board game enthusiasts to explore games and compare prices.

⚠️ Please Note: This Project is No Longer Functional

Unfortunately, due to the discontinuation of the API that powered this project, 'Board Game Connect' is no longer operational. While the app's functionality has been affected, this repository serves as a testament to my journey in iOS development and creative exploration during my senior year. Feel free to explore the code, UI design, and development practices that went into bringing 'Board Game Connect' to life.

Thank you for visiting this repository and sharing in my journey. If you have any questions or would like to discuss the project further, please don't hesitate to reach out.
